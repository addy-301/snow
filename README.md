This is one of the projects I made while learning JS.
This is a very basic project.
Basic Structure is prepared with HTML and then features are added through CSS.
For the count-down timer and animating snowflakes so that they fall repeatedly JS has been used.

**This project is free to use for any kind of practice and stuff. Enjoy!**
